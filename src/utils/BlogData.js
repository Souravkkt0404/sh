      title1: 'Divorce Mediation',
      content1: `Divorce mediation is a new process in India where husband and wife meet a legal third-party person
      who helps to resolve their dispute at the earliest. This Mediation under an alternative resolution dispute (ADR)
      is a process where the parties will not go through the legal process. Instead, this process helps to resolve issues
      through methods such as negotiation, mediation, and arbitration. In a trial, someone else decides the issues, and once
      the judge decides, one party might be dissatisfied with the outcome. In divorce mediation, it is an amicable and mutual
      decision of both parties, creating a win-win situation. Additionally, there are cost savings in divorce mediation, as
      you don't need to pay court fees, costs for making papers, appearing in court multiple times, or advocate fees.
      The main advantage of divorce mediation is that it avoids delays, allowing you to conclude your divorce within a few sessions
      and save time.
  
      Divorce litigation requires a significant investment of time and money. It takes a toll on your social life, health,
      and emotions. These issues can be resolved through divorce mediation, which is often seen as a more cost-effective
      and less painful alternative. Here's how you can achieve a successful divorce mediation:
  
      Divorce mediation is a private and confidential process facilitated by a neutral mediator to work out and settle the divorce
      of the parties. A successful divorce mediation can be achieved in a few simple steps. Before entering into the mediation,
      you should understand the effects of your case and outline your issues in front of the mediator.
  
      There are four primary aspects in divorce mediation:
      - Child Custody
      - Child Support
      - Permanent Alimony
      - Distribution of Assets
  
      You should know your rights and obligations, avoiding agents. Active participation helps you understand both your and the
      other party's perspectives. Set clear financial goals for the mediation. Keep control of your emotions, avoiding hurtful words
      that hinder the process. Remember that personal comments can disrupt the mediation.
  
      Be prepared to negotiate rather than argue. Focus on the custody of your child and avoid unnecessary conflict. Having a lawyer
      in the mediation can assist with negotiation and finalizing settlements to ensure favorable terms for you.`,
  
      title2: 'Judicial Separation',
      content2: `Judicial Separation falls under Section 10 of the Hindu Marriage Act. It means the termination of marital obligations
      by the court, where husband and wife remain legally married but are not required to perform their marital duties, such as cohabiting.
      The main purpose of Section 10 is to preserve the bond of marriage. For example, if a husband and wife have a temporary misunderstanding
      or a decision to separate, the court can grant a decree of judicial separation. If they later regret their decision, they can cancel
      the separation decree and resume their marital duties.
  
      After obtaining a decree of judicial separation, if the parties still wish to separate and have not resumed cohabitation after one year,
      they can apply for a divorce under Section 13(1A)(i) on the grounds of judicial separation. The court has discretionary powers, and if
      it deems divorce unnecessary, the parties can get a decree of judicial separation after one year under Section 13A of the Hindu Marriage Act.
  
      Grounds under Section 13(1) for both Judicial Separation and Divorce include:
      - Adultery
      - Cruelty
      - Desertion
      - Conversion
      - Unsoundness of Mind
      - Venereal disease
      - Renunciation
      - Presumed dead
  
      Grounds under Section 13(1A) for Judicial Separation include:
      - Non-resumption of cohabitation for one year or more after judicial separation
      - No restitution of conjugal rights.
  
      Effects of Judicial Separation:
      - Parties are not bound to live together or cohabit.
      - Marriage still legally exists.
      - Parties are free to resume cohabitation.
      - If cohabitation is not resumed for 1 year or more, it becomes grounds for divorce under Section 13(1A)(i).
      - If the husband forces the wife for sexual intercourse after the decree of judicial separation, the husband can be liable for
      punishment under Section 376B IPC, ranging from 2 to 7 years.
  
      Rescission of the Judicial Separation Decree: Either party can apply to the court under Section 10(2) to cancel the decree of
      judicial separation. They must provide explanations and true statements in the petition, and the court can cancel the decree
      of judicial separation granted under Section 10(1).
  
      Difference between Judicial Separation and Divorce:
      Judicial Separation:
      - Termination of Marital Obligations.
      - Marriage still subsists.
      - Parties can't solemnize a second marriage.
      - Possibility of reconciliation.
  
      Divorce:
      - Termination of Marriage.
      - Parties are free to marry someone else.
      - No possibility of reconciliation.`,
